Milestones to complete.
1.Implement peer to peer messaging using ipfs.
2.Implement Decentralized storage in MongoDB.
3.Test decentralized storage implemented in MongoDB and find alternatives if required.
4.Create and test smart contracts for access & storage purposes.

P2P communication
1.ipfs protocol may be used to for file transfer(audio video photo)-first uploaded into the distributed storage by the sender and fetched from the distributed servers by the reciever.
2.text messages may be transferred using a conventional protocol and  then store in the clients local database.
3.conventional protocol can only be feasible if both users are online but if one of em is offline then we may need to find an alternative for that.
