this subsection of code allows to establish a UDP based connection between 2 systems connected to same LAN(WIFI network).
we need atleast 2 devices to run the chat system
1.client systems or systems which will chat with each other must have client.py file
2.server system must have the server.py file

Execution
1.Run server.py in server system-python server.py
2.Run client.py file in client systems or in a new terminal window in server system(if only two devices are only present)-python client.py
3.In server system terminal,once client.py is executed then register msgs will be seen in server system with client IPs.
4.Once connected chat window will open in both client systems then we can start chatting

Role of Server system(host of server.py)
this system is just to exchange ip address of both client systems to establish the connection.once UDP connection is established then role of server.py is over.

IP address
->IPv4 address is used and in server.py we need to add the servers's private IPv4 address so that clients can find the server for establishing the connection.
->to get private IPv4 address type ipconfig in terminal.
Note:Ipv4 address can change so beware and also the clients first punch a hole in firewall before establishing the connection.
